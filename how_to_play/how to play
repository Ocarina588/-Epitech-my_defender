Welcome to our tower defense ! 
In order to get the most out of a complete 
and exciting gaming experience please read
 the following instructions carefully:

Monster stat:
Elephant: 300 HP, Slow
Fox: 150 HP, Fast
Man: 250 HP, Normal

Like in any tower defense you need a map. 
We offer you several in order to play the
game directly.
If you want you can create a map yourself.

Map requirements:
Use the file "Your Map" in the map folder.
Please don't touch the '.' and 'x' frames
already in the file.
This frame represents the border of your 
window so everything you create inside this
frame will be in the window.
The path must start at the beginning of the
file. The path should start to the 
right of the x located on the first colon 
and end on the x of the last colon.
The path consists of 'x' and '.'

Now letâ€™s see how we play our tower defense.

This tower defense works in waves of enemies.
If 3 enemies arrive at the end of your 
file you have lost. The number of waves 
is infinite. You can put the 4 four types
of tower or you want on the map as long as
it is near the path.

Putting down a tower will cost you 20 pieces.
To place it nothing simpler, select the type
of tower at the bottom of your map and left
click on the location of your choice. To sell
them double click on the tower you will get
10 pieces. To improve a tower and increase
its demage, radius and tower and gunshot per
second by 20% right click on this one.
Finally killing an enemy will get you 5 pieces.
A pause menu is available by pressing echap.

Good game and have fun!!!
